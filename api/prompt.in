identify and list out any variable names or function/class names alongside a
score. This score ranges from 0 to 10 with 0 being a poor variable
name. While 10 is a perfect and *accurate* as well as descriptive variable name.

Also, include suggestions for *better* variable/function/class names.



If the user does not provide Source Code (in Python) please respond with "I
